# SteamLookup
Basically just a bad python script that attempts to cleanly return and display information retrieved by steams api. 

# Use
You must get a steam api key which is explained if you just press enter when it asks for your api key. 
When you have a validated api key just select the 1st option and enter a users steam id, or User Name.
